Add 1 heaped cup macaroni (125 grams macaroni). stir with a fork.
Begin to cook macaroni on medium to high flame till they are al dente – meaning they should have a slight bite to them.
Drain all the water and keep cooked macaroni aside.
Cooking Vegetables

Sauté till the garlic is light brown or till its raw aroma goes away.
Next add ⅓ cup finely chopped onions. 
Mix and sauté onions on a medium-low flame stirring often till they become translucent.
Next add 1 cup tightly packed finely chopped tomatoes. mix well.
Cover the pan with lid. In between do check when cooking tomatoes.
Cook tomatoes on a low to medium-low flame till they soften and become pulpy. 
Lower the flame and then add all the spice powders one by one. 
Mix and sauté the spice powders for some seconds till you get a nice aroma from the spice powders.
Then add 1.25 to 1.5 cups of mix vegetables. Also add ¼ cup green peas.
Season with salt as per taste and mix very well.
Pour 1 cup water and mix again. Cover the pan with lid.
On a medium-low to medium flame simmer till the vegetables are cooked. In between do check and if the water has become less you can add some more water.
